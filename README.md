## Use a CSS and JavaScript Framework to Add Interactivity to a Website

In this assignment, I utilited the CSS Framework Bootstrap to minimize custom CSS needed for my site as well as add interactivity to my site. 

Specifically, I made use of the following Bootstrap components:
- mobile-responsive navbar
- responsive grid system
- spacing utilities
- cards and buttons
