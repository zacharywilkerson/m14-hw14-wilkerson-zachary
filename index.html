            <p class="card-text">Originally born in Florida, I grew up spending most of my time outdoors. I enjoyed going to the beach and soaking up the sun. Academically, I was always a stand out student. I excelled in the field of mathematics, completing the highest level courses offered at my school and competing in math competitions across the region.</p>
              <p>For college, I decided to move out of the state to Masssachusetts. Here, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University's College of Engineering in May 2019. After working for a year, I decided to return to Florida and continue my education at the University of Florida. I am expected to obtain my Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Florida's College of Engineering in May 2022.</p>
                <p>I also hold a Machine Learning certificate through the University of Florida.</p>

            <p class="card-text">I first began playing volleyball in high school in 2011. I played on the indoor varsity team for four years until graduation. Entering college, I decided to continue playing through Boston University's club volleyball program. As a starting freshman, I led my team to a National Championship win. Outside of this program, I also competed with an adult club team that played all throughout New England. </p>
            <p>After leaving New England to return to Florida, I joined the University of Florida's club volleyball program. I also take advantage of the sun and sand to play beach volleyball as well.</p>
            <p>I try my best to record all games I compete in and upload them online to Youtube for later viewing.</p>
